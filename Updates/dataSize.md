Basic size table information:
Kilobyte 	kB 	10^3 B (1000 B) 	Kibibyte 	KiB 	2^10 B (or 1024 B)
Megabyte 	MB 	10^6 B (1000 kB) 	Mebibyte 	MiB 	2^20 B (or 1024 KiB)
Gigabyte 	GB 	10^9 B (1000 MB) 	Gibibyte 	GiB 	2^30 B (or 1024 MiB)
Terabyte 	TB 	10^12 B (1000 GB) 	Tebibyte 	TiB 	2^40 B (or 1024 GiB)
Petabyte 	PB 	10^15 B (1000 TB) 	Pebibyte 	PiB 	2^50 B (or 1024 TiB)
8 bits = 1 bytes

The first one is a decimal-based system, which uses bytes in the powers of ten: kilobyte (10^3 bytes), megabyte (10^6 bytes), and gigabyte (10^9 bytes) and so on. These units are used by the International System of Units (SI). The second one is a binary-based system which uses bytes in the powers of two: kilobyte (2^10 bytes), megabyte (2^20 bytes), gigabyte (2^30 bytes) and so on. This system was actively used to describe computer memory.

Note IEC created the Binary standard name. Article of interest to read for more clarification:
