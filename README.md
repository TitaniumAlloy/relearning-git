About me:
Hello, I use to able to write code until I ended up with a career path that put me far away from it.
Now, I am taking my spare time to relearn what was lost so I can transition into a programming career that I always sought.

Re-learning git first part:
So far what I learned from the site's tutorial is when you creating repository a main branch is created.
A main branch can split into other sub branches by clicking the drop down button on main in the top left and writing a name.
Main branch is where the code that is published is located while the sub branches are where the edits are made before merging with the main branch.
The branch you name will be a copy of the main branch and purpose of it is for editting/features/bug fixes etc.
Right now I will commit these changes. This will be updated with notes to every changes I make for each repository.

Tracks for the Java projects on this read me file for my own purpose and goal:

    Understand the syntax of Java and write well readable and efficient code
    Work with professional development tools and GitHub
    Apply the principles of object-oriented programming widely used in commercial development
    Simplify your application design with functional programming
    Use collections to effectively process data in your application
    Use multicore processing to optimize the speed of your app
    Use the Swing library for desktop development
    Build an efficient web application with SpringBoot
    Work with data formats like JSON and XML
    Work with databases


I will be adding programming and scripting projects as I learn.
